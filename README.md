**Myne** is a [FOSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android application to download ebooks from the [Project GutenBerg](https://gutenberg.org), it uses [GutenDex](https://gutendex.com) API to fetch metadata of ebooks in the backend.

*The name of the app is inspired from the main character of an anime called [Ascendance of a Bookworm](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39468/Honzuki_no_Gekokujou__Shisho_ni_Naru_Tame_ni_wa_Shudan_wo_Erandeiraremasen)*.

**Note** The app also uses [Google Books](https://books.google.co.in/) API to fetch some extra data like book summary and pages count etc, as the GutenBerg project don't include those values in their metadata. It tries it's best to map the data received from Google books with Gutenberg's
metadata but the mapping is not 100% accurate and not all books available on GutenBerg is also available on Google books or is available but with different title, so you may find some books without summary or page count etc.

Or you could just buy the app from Google Play Store. You'll get constant updates without the need to get all the way here and download the release all by yourself and install the release all by yourself and then you realize you have a different package name so you contact me but I really don't have time for this so I update it on google play and then you realize your installer doesn't work and then you realize your whole life is like this, miserable and not working but then you see a point of light in the distance so you run towards and it's the "Buy" button in the Myne's page on google play, it'll make your life easier.

<h2 align="center">Translations</h2>

If you want to make app available in your language, you're very welcome to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your translation file.
The string resources can be found under `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. It is easiest to make a translation using the Android Studio XML editor, but you can always go with your favorite XML-text editor instead.
